# Skeleton UI Design System Kit ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

A starter _skeleton_ that gives **you** the _bare bones_ needed to get up and running with building design systems.

Skeleton UI is built with React, Typescript, [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui), [Styled System](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system), and emotion and structured as a monorepo using Lerna.

Skeleton UI is a simple and unopinionated starter kit with a small set of components built on top of customizable theme-based design scales that help you build UI rooted in constraint-based design principles. Customize, configure, and adjust these design scales inside of the theme object to your liking. 

**This kit is meant to be cloned and made into your own, custom design system**. 

## Usage

### Clone or Use Template

To start building out your own design system run `git clone https://github.com/coreybruyere/skeleton-ui.git` **or** click 'Use this template' button on the top of this page.

## Features

Skeleton UI comes packaged with both Styled System and Theme UI. Giving you a fully customizable API where you can reference your theme with styled props or the `sx` prop.

- Theme-based styling with the `sx` prop from [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui).
