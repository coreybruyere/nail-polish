# Skeleton UI Design System Kit ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

A starter _skeleton_ that gives **you** the _bare bones_ needed to get up and running with building design systems.

Skeleton UI is built with React, Typescript, [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui), [Styled System](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system), and emotion and structured as a monorepo using Lerna.

This design system kit comes with a minimal, basic theme which you can configure as you please. This gives you the power to use it as a starting point for your next design system. **This kit is meant to be cloned and made into your own, custom design system**. 

## Usage

### Clone or Use Template

Skeleton UI is a starter, _bare bones_ template that enables you to build, theme, and design components as you'd like.

git clone https://github.com/coreybruyere/skeleton-ui.git`

**or**

Click 'Use this template' button on the top of this page.

## Features
