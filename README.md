# Skeleton UI Design System Kit ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

A starter _skeleton_ that gives **you** the _bare bones_ needed to get up and running with building design systems.

Skeleton UI is built with React, Typescript, Theme UI, styled-system, and emotion and structured as a monorepo using Lerna.

This design system kit comes with a minimal, basic theme which you can configure as you please. This gives you the power to use it as a starting point for your next design system. **This kit is meant to be cloned and made into your own, custom design system**. 

## Usage

### Clone and make your own

Skeleton UI is a starter, _bare bones_ template that enables you to build, theme, and design components as you'd like. Use Skeleton UI as a starting point for your next design system!
