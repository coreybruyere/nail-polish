# Skeleton UI Design System Kit ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

A starter _skeleton_ that gives **you** the _bare bones_ needed to get up and running with building design systems.

Skeleton UI is built with React, Theme UI, styled-system, and emotion and structured as a monorepo using Lerna.

This design system kit comes with a minimal, basic theme which you can configure as you please. This gives you the power to use it as a starting point for your next design system **or** you can consume it in your next project as starter component library to build out components.

## Usage

### Clone and make your own

Skeleton UI is a starter, _bare bones_ template that enables you to build, theme, and design components as you'd like. Use Skeleton UI as a starting point for your new design system.

<!-- # Typescript reproduction issue

1. Clone project
2. `npm i` in root (or lerna bootstrap)
3. `cd` into `packages/core` and `npm i`
4. install yalc globally (skip steps 4 - 5 if just using current version to see Ts errors) `npm/yarn install -g yalc`
5. In `packages/core` run `yalc publish`
6. `cd...` up and into `prepublish-test`
7. `yalc add @skeleton-ui/core` and `npm i`
8. Open `prepublish-test/src/App.tsx`
9. View error when hovering over `Button` component on line 11.
10. In `prepublish-test/node_modules/@skeleton-ui/dist/components/Button/Button.d.ts` you'll see the compiled defintion. In `prepublish-test/node_modules/@skeleton-ui/src/components/Button` you'll see the Button component. Its there I've been making changes and manually checking TS errors inside of App.tsx -->
