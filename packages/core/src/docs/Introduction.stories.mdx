# Skeleton UI

Skeleton UI is a starter _skeleton_ that gives **you** the _bare bones_ needed to get up and running with building design systems.

Skeleton UI is built with React, Typescript, [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui), [Styled System](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system), and emotion and structured as a monorepo using Lerna.

Skeleton UI is a simple and unopinionated starter kit with a small set of components built on top of customizable theme-based design scales that help you build UI rooted in constraint-based design principles. Customize, configure, and adjust these design scales inside of the theme object to your liking.
